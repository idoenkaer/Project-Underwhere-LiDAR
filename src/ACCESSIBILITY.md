## Key Accessibility Features

To support our commitment, we have implemented several key features that allow users to customize their experience for better clarity and comfort.

### 1. High Contrast Mode

For users who find the default "Vintage Green Terminal" theme difficult to read, especially in bright environments, we provide a High Contrast Mode.

-   **What it does:** Switches the application to a high-contrast dark theme with white text and standard UI colors for maximum legibility.
-   **How to enable:** Navigate to **Settings > Accessibility** and toggle "High Contrast Mode".

### 2. Reduce Motion & Effects

For users who are sensitive to motion or prefer a more static interface, we offer an option to disable all non-essential animations and visual effects.

-   **What it does:** Disables all UI animations, transitions, and glow effects across the application, providing a distraction-free experience.
-   **How to enable:** Navigate to **Settings > Accessibility** and toggle "Reduce Motion & Effects".

### 3. Font Size Control

To ensure text is readable for users with varying visual needs, the application's global font size can be adjusted.

-   **What it does:** Increases or decreases the base font size for most text throughout the user interface.
-   **How to enable:** Navigate to **Settings > Typography** and select your preferred font size (Small, Default, or Large).

### 4. Keyboard Navigation

The application is designed to be navigable using a keyboard.
- All interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links) are focusable.
- A logical tab order is maintained.
- Keyboard shortcuts are available for power users (see **Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts**).

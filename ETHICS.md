# Project Underwhere: Ethical Framework

## Our Commitment

Project Underwhere is a powerful scientific tool with the potential for significant real-world impact. With this power comes a profound responsibility. This document outlines our commitment to ethical development, responsible use, and positive community engagement. By using or contributing to this project, you agree to uphold these principles.

---

### 1. Guiding Principles

-   **Scientific & Social Good:** We connect project goals to broader scientific and social good—not just technical achievement. Our aim is to empower research that benefits humanity and the planet.
-   **Human Rights:** We align the software's intended usage with the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ensuring it serves to uplift and protect, not harm.

---

### 2. Data Management & Provenance

-   **Full Traceability:** We commit to documenting all workflows and the complete provenance of data, from acquisition to analysis and publication.
-   **Transparency in Methods:** We will always disclose the limitations and sources of our algorithms to ensure scientific reproducibility and prevent misinterpretation.
-   **Licensing & Attribution:** We will scrupulously respect the licensing and attribution requirements for all data and code used within the project.

---

### 3. Data Privacy & Security

-   **Consent is Paramount:** We will always seek explicit consent for data collection and respect indigenous and local data governance protocols.
-   **No Unauthorized Sharing:** We will not process or share sensitive data without explicit, informed permissions from the data owners or subjects.
-   **Privacy by Design:** We will mask or restrict coordinates for sensitive ecological, cultural, or residential sites by default.
-   **Handling Sensitive Data:** Sensitive point clouds may only be made available to credentialed researchers, and may have key metadata redacted to protect privacy, even if this limits some forms of validation. Access to raw, privacy-sensitive datasets will be strictly controlled.

---

### 4. Community & Governance

-   **Clear Codes of Conduct:** We will publish and maintain clear Codes of Conduct and Ethics Statements for all contributors and users.
-   **Inclusive Governance:** We will design our community governance structures to be inclusive, transparent, and accountable to all stakeholders.
-   **Respectful Engagement:** We will engage with the user and contributor community openly, transparently, and respectfully, fostering a collaborative environment.

---

### 5. Responsible Innovation & Use

-   **Dual-Use Awareness:** We will actively flag the potential for dual-use (benevolent and harmful applications) of this technology, especially in our documentation and outreach.
-   **Regulatory Compliance:** We will monitor regulatory changes related to geospatial data, AI, and privacy, and will train maintainers and contributors on best practices accordingly.
